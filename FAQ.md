# Frequently Asked Questions


#### Q: What is this?
A: DasBlog Core  is an open source blogging engine based heavily on the  work produced by a community of volunteers and contributors who helped make [the original DasBlog a very popular blogging option](https://github.com/shanselman/dasblog).


#### Q: Does this replace the original DasBlog?
A: We think so. The original DasBlog relies on Web Forms and will not be supported on .NET Core platform going forward.
